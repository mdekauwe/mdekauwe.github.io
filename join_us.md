Potential students that have an interest in exploring research questions related to the response of the carbon and water cycles to global change are  encouraged to get in contact. Students should have a background in biology, mathematics, physics, atmospheric science, engineering or a similar quantitative sciences. 

I would be very keen to welcome visitors so please get in contact!

### Current opportunities

- <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/biology/courses/postgraduate/phdstudentships/" style="color:#16a085">PhD: Plants on the edge: examining the resilience of the vegetation to climate extremes</a>

Climate change is rapidly altering the growing conditions of terrestrial ecosystems, with widespread evidence of more frequent, more intense, and longer duration droughts and heatwaves. Examining the response and recovery of plants to droughts and heatwaves provides valuable insight into the species resilience we may anticipate from climate change. Thus, an improved understanding of plant responses as conditions become extremes is fundamental to our capacity to accurately simulate future changes in the carbon/water cycles and predict associated changes in species distributions.

The student will seek to uncover the underlying resilience of plants by integrating ecosystem responses to meteorological extremes with those occurring across natural gradients as the climate warms. You will make extensive use of observations (eddy covariance and experiments), and use innovative quantitative techniques to probe the theory embedded within models. The student will also have the opportunity to run and develop their chosen modelling tool (either stand-scale or land surface; JULES/CABLE). This project will ensure that future predictions accurately capture plant responses to changes in temperature, humidity, and water availability.

This project will draw on supervisory expertise that bridges ecophysiology, model-data fusion, vegetation modelling, and remote sensing. The PhD will split into achievable milestones, allowing the student to work clearly towards targets (including scientific papers), while still maintaining intellectual freedom to refine project directions.

Candidate requirements:

A strong background in biology, mathematics, physics, atmospheric science, engineering or a similar quantitative science are encouraged to apply. Programming experience with Python, R, C/C++ or Fortran 90 is highly desirable, but not essential. A strong drive to understand the dynamics of plant ecosystems is essential.

Interested students should contact me directly to discuss the project. Student applications are encouraged from under-represented groups. <b>The deadline for applications is the April 28th 2022.</b> Further application details can be found at: <a href="https://bristol.ac.uk/life-sciences/study/postgraduate/intphdstudentships/" style="color:#16a085">click me</a>.
