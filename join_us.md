- <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/biology/courses/postgraduate/phdstudentships/" style="color:#000000">PhD: Unlocking the scaling puzzle in forest carbon and water fluxes</a>

The global terrestrial carbon and water cycles are inextricably linked, dominated by leaf-scale processes (e.g., photosynthesis and stomatal conductance). Consequently, we construct global vegetation models using leaf-level understanding of plant responses to environmental cues. However, when we evaluate model prediction at ecosystem scales (~km<sup>2</sup>), we find critical discrepancies in estimated and observed carbon and water fluxes, signifying an important gap in our understanding of leaf-to-ecosystem scaling. Furthermore, datasets derived at leaf-, canopy- and ecosystem- scales are rarely consistent. Our inability to explain these biases in both models and observations limits our capacity to accurately predict vegetation responses to future climate.

The student will have the opportunity to develop novel hypotheses to examine why leaf, canopy, and ecosystem-scale fluxes differ. The student will leverage ecosystem modelling alongside a suite of evidence streams including: leaf-level photosynthesis; sap flow (to monitor individual tree water use); cutting-edge canopy solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) measurements (proxy for canopy-scale photosynthetic activity); eddy-covariance; and LiDAR (to quantify canopy structural variability). In particular, the student will deliver new process-orientated insight into how the exchange of carbon and water varies at contracting time scales (e.g., seasonal, annual), as well as during summer temperature extremes. The project will focus on Forest Research’s Alice Holt (Hampshire), an 80-year old lowland oak plantation eddy covariance (H<sub>2</sub>O/CO<sub>2</sub>) flux site.

This project will draw on supervisory expertise that bridges ecophysiology, model-data fusion, vegetation modelling, and remote sensing. The PhD will split into achievable milestones, allowing the student to work clearly towards targets (including scientific papers), while still maintaining intellectual freedom to refine project directions.

Candidate requirements:

A strong background in biology, mathematics, physics, atmospheric science, engineering or a similar quantitative science are encouraged to apply. Programming experience with C/C++, Fortran 90, Python or R is highly desirable, but not essential. A strong drive to understand the dynamics of plant ecosystems is essential. We welcome and encourage student applications from under-represented groups. We value a diverse research environment.

Interested students should contact me directly to discuss the project. <b>The deadline for applications is the January 9th 2023.</b> Further application details can be found at: <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/biology/courses/postgraduate/phdstudentships/" style="color:#16a085">click me</a>.

### Current opportunities

- <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/biology/courses/postgraduate/phdstudentships/" style="color:#16a085">PhD: Plants on the edge: examining the resilience of the vegetation to climate extremes</a>

Climate change is rapidly altering the growing conditions of terrestrial ecosystems, with widespread evidence of more frequent, more intense, and longer duration droughts and heatwaves. Examining the response and recovery of plants to droughts and heatwaves provides valuable insight into the species resilience we may anticipate from climate change. Thus, an improved understanding of plant responses as conditions become extremes is fundamental to our capacity to accurately simulate future changes in the carbon/water cycles and predict associated changes in species distributions.

The student will seek to uncover the underlying resilience of plants by integrating ecosystem responses to meteorological extremes with those occurring across natural gradients as the climate warms. You will make extensive use of observations (eddy covariance and experiments), and use innovative quantitative techniques to probe the theory embedded within models. The student will also have the opportunity to run and develop their chosen modelling tool (either stand-scale or land surface; JULES/CABLE). This project will ensure that future predictions accurately capture plant responses to changes in temperature, humidity, and water availability.

This project will draw on supervisory expertise that bridges ecophysiology, model-data fusion, vegetation modelling, and remote sensing. The PhD will split into achievable milestones, allowing the student to work clearly towards targets (including scientific papers), while still maintaining intellectual freedom to refine project directions.
