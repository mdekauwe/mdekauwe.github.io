      <p> <b><i>Forecasting future forest vulnerability</i></b> </br>

      <p>The Postdoctoral Research Associate will work on an ARC-funded project exploring how vulnerable Australia’s eucalypts are to future droughts. This project will combine data-synthesis, experimental manipulation and modelling to deliver new process-orientated insight into the response of Eucalyptus trees to projected changes in the frequency, magnitude and duration of future droughts across Australia. The role will involve key process-based model development of the Community Atmosphere–Biosphere Land Exchange model (CABLE), Australia’s land surface model. These developments will include the representation of plant hydraulics and testing novel optimality-based hypotheses related to leaf shedding, leaf cooling and rooting depth. The project offers the candidate the opportunity to work closely with researchers with expertise bridging ecophysiology, model-data fusion, land and climate modelling.</p>

      <p>We seek a candidate who has experience in using land surface and/or climate models combined with a strong understanding of the underlying ecophysiology processes. Programming experience is essential and languages such as Fortran90, C, Python and R are common in our field.</p>

      <p>The role of Postdoctoral Research Associate reports to <a href="https://mdekauwe.github.io/" style="text-decoration: none;">Dr Martin De Kauwe (The Unversity of New South Wales) </a> and has no direct reports. During the project, the candidate will have the opportunity to work closely with the other project investigators: <a href="https://biology.anu.edu.au/people/patrick-meir" style="text-decoration: none;">Professor Patrick Meir (The Australian National University)</a>, <a href="https://research.jcu.edu.au/portfolio/lucas.cernusak/" style="text-decoration: none;">A/Prof. Lucas Cernusak (James Cook University)</a>, <a href="https://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au/ccrc-team/academic-research/andy-pitman" style="text-decoration: none;">Professor Andrew Pitman (The Unversity of New South Wales)</a> and <a href="https://people.csiro.au/H/V/Vanessa-Haverd" style="text-decoration: none;">Dr Vanessa Haverd (CSIRO)</a>.</p>

      <p>The position will be based at the Climate Change Research Centre (CCRC) at the University of New South Wales, Sydney. The CCRC is a multi-disciplinary research group comprising one of the largest university research facilities of its kind in Australia. CCRC houses research expertise in the key project areas of atmospheric convection and global climate modelling. The centre also houses expertise in global climate change and extremes of weather and climate. Our oceans program focuses on global ocean thermohaline circulation, water-mass formation, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, western boundary currents, and the ocean carbon cycle. On the land surface we focus on modelling terrestrial processes in climate models, to develop our understanding of the effects of carbon dynamics, hydrology and vegetation processes on climate.</p>

      <p> The CCRC is comprised of 11 full time academic staff, approximately 20 postdoctoral fellows, and over 36 PhD, Masters and Honours students.</p>


      <p> Questions should be directed to Martin De Kauwe (m.dekauwe@unsw.edu.au).  </p>

      <p> <b><i>1. Unravelling the role of lags and legacies in explaining the response of grasslands to elevated CO<sub>2</sub></i></b> </br>

      <p>The rising concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere stimulates plant growth; however, in grassland ecosystems, the observed growth responses are highly variable and often depart markedly from our theoretical predictions. Our inability to explain the reasons for this variability prevents us from predicting changes in agricultural productivity and ultimately, the future grassland carbon sink. This project will apply a state of the art, hierarchical Bayesian modelling framework to determine how past climatic conditions influence current responses to high CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. The project will use data from a new, specially-designed experiment, as well as results from past Free-Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment (FACE) and Open-top chamber (OTC) experiments, to close this knowledge gap. In particular, the student will aim to identify the mechanisms and timescales over which past water and nutrient availability affect photosynthesis and growth responses to CO<sub>2</sub> in grasslands.</p>

      <p> The project is based at the <a href="http://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au" style="text-decoration: none;">Climate Change Research Centre (CCRC)</a> at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia, under the supervision of Dr Martin De Kauwe, <a href="http://www2.nau.edu/ogle-lab/" style="text-decoration: none;">Professor Kiona Ogle</a> at Northern Arizona University (NAU) and <a href="http://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/plant-science/Mark-Hovenden" style="text-decoration: none;">Associate Professor Mark Hovenden</a> at the University of Tasmania (UTAS). </p>

      <p> The successful candidate will become part of the <a href="https://climateextremes.org.au/" style="text-decoration: none;">Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes</a>, an international research consortium of five Australian universities (The University of New South Wales, Monash University, The University of Melbourne, The University of Tasmania and The Australian National University) and a suite of outstanding national and international Partner Organizations. The Centre provides excellent opportunities for travel and graduate student development. In particular, there are funds available to travel to Arizona and work closely with Professor Ogle during the PhD scholarship.  </p>

      <p> We are looking for expressions of interest from outstanding graduates with a strong academic record including Honours Class I or equivalent. Graduates with a strong background in plant ecophysiology, mathematics, physics, atmospheric science, engineering or similar quantitative sciences are particularly encouraged to apply. Programming experience with R or Python is desirable but not essential. </p>

      <p> Questions should be directed to Martin De Kauwe (m.dekauwe@unsw.edu.au). Expressions of interest including a CV, full academic transcript, and the names of up to three academic referees should be sent to climate.grad@unsw.edu.au by the 1st of September, 2019. Note: this is not an official application, if your expression of interest is accepted, we  will guide you through the application process. </p>

      <p> <b><i>2. Water, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and growth: plant ecophysiological responses in a Free Air CO<sub>2</sub> Enrichment experiment</i></b> </br>

      <p>This project presents a rare opportunity to work in one of the world’s few Free Air CO<sub>2</sub> Enrichment (FACE) experiments, a cutting-edge global change manipulation experiment, located in southern Tasmania, Australia. The rising concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere should stimulate plant growth but often doesn’t and our inability to explain the reasons for this lack of response prevents us from predicting global carbon balances and future agricultural productivity. This project will involve measurements in a cutting-edge global change field experiment to close this knowledge gap by examining plant growth responses to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> during repeated drought cycles. In particular, the candidate will aim to identify the mechanisms and timescales over which past water and nutrient availability affect photosynthesis and growth responses to CO<sub>2</sub> in grasslands, which is crucial for improving models of future plant growth and land-atmosphere interactions.</p>

      <p>This project is fully funded by the Australian Research Council. The successful candidate will be based in the <a href="http://www.utas.edu.au/natural-sciences" style="text-decoration: none;">School of Natural Sciences at the University of Tasmania</a> and jointly supervised by <a href="http://www.utas.edu.au/profiles/staff/plant-science/Mark-Hovenden" style="text-decoration: none;">Associate Professor Mark Hovenden</a> at  the University of Tasmania (UTAS) and <a href="https://mdekauwe.github.io/" style="text-decoration: none;">Dr Martin De Kauwe</a> at the University of New South Wales (UNSW)</p>
