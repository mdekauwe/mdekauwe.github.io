Our research group investigates how plants respond to global environmental changes, including rising CO<sub>2</sub>, increasing temperatures, and shifting water availability. We integrate diverse observation streams — such as manipulation experiments, eddy covariance, and satellite data — with vegetation models and statistical methods to enhance our understanding and improve predictions of future ecosystem change.

We tackle a diverse range of questions that connect terrestrial ecosystems with climate, including:

- How will plants acclimate and adapt to rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration?
- To what extent can plants adjust their physiology and function under environmental stress?
- Can we predict when and where trees with die during droughts?
- Can we anticipate how changing disturbance regimes will reshape forest structure, function, and recovery trajectories?
- How do past environmental conditions shape ecosystem resilience to droughts and heatwaves?
- How does plant function regulate land-atmosphere feedbacks during climate extremes?
- How will plant responses to environmental change alter the terrestrial hydrological cycle?
- How resilient are species distributions to climate change, and how will they shift in the future?
- How effectively can nature-based forest restoration mitigate the impacts of droughts and heatwaves?
- Which species should we plant in future landscapes and cities to enhance climate resilience?

<p> Modelling is central tool used by our research group to understand, disentangle and project how climate change will shape future vegetation-atmosphere dynamics. Our group employs models of varying complexity, from simple (<a href="https://github.com/mdekauwe/GDAY" style="color:#16a085">GDAY</a>), to the more complex: stand (<a href="http://maespa.github.io/" style="color:#16a085;">MAESPA</a>), land surface (<a href="https://trac.nci.org.au/trac/cable/wiki" style="color:#16a085;">CABLE</a>, <a href="https://jules.jchmr.org/" style="color:#16a085;">JULES</a>), dynamic vegetation (<a href="http://iis4.nateko.lu.se/lpj-guess/" style="color:#16a085;">LPJ-GUESS</a>; SDGVM) and coupled-climate (<a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/OandA/Areas/Assessing-our-climate/CAWCR/ACCESS" style="color:#16a085;">ACCESS</a>) models. </p>

Science may be described as the art of systematic over-simplification-the art of discerning what we may with advantage omit" </i> - Karl Popper</span>
