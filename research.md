Our research focuses on understanding how plants respond to global environmental change: increasing CO<sub>2</sub>, temperature, and changing water availability. We integrate a range of observation streams (*e.g.*, manipulation experiments, eddy covariance, and satellite data) with vegetation models to improve our capacity to predict future ecosystem change.

We tackle a diverse range of questions that connect terrestrial ecosystems with climate, including:

- how will plants respond to increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>Â concentration?
- can we predict when and where trees might die of drought-induced mortality?
- how do we improve our predictions of vegetation function as water and temperature become limiting?
- what role does legacy to past environmental conditions (days-years) play in our capacity to predict current plant function?
- how resilient are species distributions to climate change and how will distributions shift in the future?
- how does plant physiology affect land-atmosphere feedbacks during climate extremes?
- what impact will plants have on the future hydrological cycle?

<p> Our research group employs models of varying complexity, from simple (<a href="https://github.com/mdekauwe/GDAY" style="color:#16a085">GDAY</a>), to the more complex: stand (<a href="http://maespa.github.io/" style="color:#16a085;">MAESPA</a>), land surface (<a href="https://trac.nci.org.au/trac/cable/wiki" style="color:#16a085;">CABLE</a>), dynamic vegetation (<a href="http://iis4.nateko.lu.se/lpj-guess/" style="color:#16a085;">LPJ-GUESS</a>; SDGVM) and coupled-climate (<a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/OandA/Areas/Assessing-our-climate/CAWCR/ACCESS" style="color:#16a085;">ACCESS</a>) models. </p>


<p><i> "The method of science depends on our attempts to describe the world with simple theories: theories that are complex may become untestable, even if they happen to be true. Science may be described as the art of systematic over-simplification-the art of discerning what we may with advantage omit" </i> - Karl Popper. </p>
