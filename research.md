Our research group investigates how plants respond to global environmental changes, including rising CO<sub>2</sub>, increasing temperatures, and shifting water availability. We integrate diverse observation streams — such as manipulation experiments, eddy covariance, and satellite data — with vegetation models and statistical methods to enhance our understanding and improve predictions of future ecosystem change.

We tackle a diverse range of questions that connect terrestrial ecosystems with climate, including:

- how will plants adapt to increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration?
- can we predict when & where trees will die during droughts?
- to what extent can plants adjust their function in response to stress?
- how do past environmental conditions influence our ability to predict ecosystem resilience?
- how does plant function influence land-atmosphere feedbacks during climate extremes?
- how will plant responses to environmental change affect the hydrological cycle?
- how resilient are species distributions to climate change, and how will these distributions shift in the future?
- what role do urban trees play in mitigating climate-related warming, and which species should we plant in cities of the future?

<p> Modelling is central tool used by our research group to understand, disentangle and project how climate and climate change will shape future vegetation-atmosphere dynamics. Our group employs models of varying complexity, from simple (<a href="https://github.com/mdekauwe/GDAY" style="color:#16a085">GDAY</a>), to the more complex: stand (<a href="http://maespa.github.io/" style="color:#16a085;">MAESPA</a>), land surface (<a href="https://trac.nci.org.au/trac/cable/wiki" style="color:#16a085;">CABLE</a>, <a href="https://jules.jchmr.org/" style="color:#16a085;">JULES</a>), dynamic vegetation (<a href="http://iis4.nateko.lu.se/lpj-guess/" style="color:#16a085;">LPJ-GUESS</a>; SDGVM) and coupled-climate (<a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/OandA/Areas/Assessing-our-climate/CAWCR/ACCESS" style="color:#16a085;">ACCESS</a>) models. </p>

<p><i> "The method of science depends on our attempts to describe the world with simple theories: theories that are complex may become untestable, even if they happen to be true. Science may be described as the art of systematic over-simplification-the art of discerning what we may with advantage omit" </i> - Karl Popper </p>
